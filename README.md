# SR-calculations
An aggregate of calculations regularly used in systematic reviews. There are plenty of tools online to do most of these calculations, but I needed them in one place. 

This isnt meant to be a full repository of stats tools, but instead a grouping of calculations I use regularly and wanted in one place. 
Anything more complicated is worth doing in a statistical program.

Included features

Proportions and Risks: This sheet allows the quick calculations of proportions, risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals. The proportions section offers two methods: one when you have the numerator (n) and denominator (N), and another for when you have the proportion (%) and denominator. Additionally, there is a section to calculate crude risk ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals when you have summary case data. 

RR & RRmH: This tool is adapted from the rothman episheet, and allows you to calculate crude and mantel-haenszel RRs.

Crude OR: This sheet allows you to calculate crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals when you have summary case data.

OR & ORmh: This tool is adapted from the rothman episheet, and allows you to calculate crude and mantel-Haenzel ORs

Transformations: This sheet allows you to calculate standard deviations based on standard errors and 95% confidence intervals

MDs: This sheet allows you to calculate mean differences in change scores and mean differences in follow-up scores.

Tests: This sheet allows you to quickly calculate tests of association and diagnostic accuracy tests. Of note is that you can calculate Fisher's Exact Test for small samples; other than a few online tools, this has generally required speciality statistical software to do due to the difficulty in manually calculating contingency tables and probabilities.

Pooled means: This sheet allows you to quickly calculate pools means, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals for up to 4 groups.
