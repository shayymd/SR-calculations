# SR-calculations
An aggregate of calculations regularly used in systematic reviews. There are plenty of tools online to do most of these calculations, but I needed them in one place. 

This isnt meant to be a full repository of stats tools, but instead a grouping of calculations I use regularly and wanted in one place. 
Anything more complicated is worth doing in a statistical program.

Included features

Proportions and RR: This sheet allows the quick calculations of proportions, risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals. The proportions section offers two methods: one when you have the numerator (n) and denominator (N), and another for when you have the proportion (%) and denominator. Additionally, there is a section to calculate crude risk ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals when you have summary case data. 

Risk Ratio: This is a simplified sheet copying the crude risk ratio and 95% confidence interval section from the Proportions and RR sheet.

Odds Ratio: This sheet allows you to calculate crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals when you have summary case data.

SE -> SD: this sheet helps to transform standard errors (SE) to standard deviations (SE). Some studies only report standard errors, but it can be significantly easier to interpret and report data when they include standard deviations. 

95% CI -> SD: This sheet helps to transform 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to standard deviations (as well as standard errors). This is helpful when studies only report confidence intervals.

MD Change from Baseline: This sheet allows you to calculate mean difference for the change from baseline between two groups. 

MD Post-tx: This sheet allows you to calculate the mean difference in follow-up scores between two groups.

Diagnostic Performance: This sheet helps to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values based on summary case data.
